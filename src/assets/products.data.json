      "ProductTitle": "JOHN CARTER",
      "ProductDescription": "Disney's megabudget foray into a new CGI franchise of epic sci-fi mythology arrives with a massive marketing push and an interesting pulp pedigree that will probably inspire as many fans as it will naysayers. This impressively crafted piece of escapist fantasy is based on a character and series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs that is runner-up to his primary creation, Tarzan, and the 20-plus volumes he wrote about that iconic ape-raised jungle adventurer. Burroughs churned out books in both series concurrently for roughly his entire adult life in the first half of the 20th century. John Carter is a former Confederate Civil War captain and fortune-hunting ne'er-do-well who through a weird incident of astral projection is plopped down on the red planet, where he becomes a passionate warrior against beasts and humanoids for the security of a home world known to its inhabitants as Barsoom. John Carter presents this origin setup in a clever prologue that finds the cranky Carter on the run from frontier military authorities as well as a band of marauding Indians. Carter is played by Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch with great bravado. His character undergoes radical change when confronted with something he can finally care about. It doesn't hurt that an exotic princess of Mars is part of the prize package that comes from his battle against evil and ultimately doing the right thing. John Carter is a visual feast (especially in well-conceived 3-D) with an array of digital and motion-capture techniques that create an eye-popping world of strange creatures, astounding architectural vistas, aerial panoramas, and luminous landscapes. All the extraordinary detail is not surprising considering that Pixar superstar Andrew Stanton is at the helm (he also directed Finding Nemo and WALL-E). There's a lot going on in the script, and it sometimes feels as though too much work was done in the editing suite to streamline a story that is often overly complicated. Barsoom is ruled by three species, all with their own political and social agendas. There are the humans whose city-state cultures are threatened by civil war and the aggression of Tharks, a race of giant green-skinned, four-armed warriors with horrific tusks and a deeply bellicose intellect. Separate from both are the mythic Therns, a cultlike sect of Ã¼ber-beings who seek to manipulate all of Barsoom into their own submission. Added to the mix are a variety of outrageous animal creatures both vicious and sublime that make for an extremely motley ensemble of beasties. The huge cast of characters, species, and names becomes a bit confusing to keep straight in all the rapid-fire exposition. Fortunately the movie doesn't ever stop long enough to allow much time for thinking; there's something new and exciting to look at in virtually every scene. Because of some fantastical leaps of physics and gravity, Carter's Martian body possesses super strength and the ability to make single bounds over huge distances. His powers not only make him a godlike presence to the natives of Barsoom, they also provide for some dizzying feats of movie magic. The most bravura element of the conceptual design is a fleet of massive solar-powered flying machines that recall something out of H.G. Wells or a steampunk fantasy. These colorful, insectlike machines soar and float in the gold-hued Martian atmosphere with thrilling precision. Even though the multitude of beings, names, and alliances may sometimes elicit a glassy-eyed response, there's plenty of attention-grabbing exactitude to behold in John Carter. There's also a good chance that the fans will make it worth Disney's while to shell out another hundred million to keep the saga going.",

      "ProductDescription": "Frank Miller's groundbreaking Dark Knight Returns story arc is capably translated to a two-part, feature-length animated film, with the first installment serving as introduction to Miller's brooding, violent take on the venerable comic book hero. It is ten years after an aging Batman has retired, and Gotham City has sunk deeper into decadence and lawlessness. Now, when his city needs him most, the Dark Knight returns in a blaze of glory. Joined by Carrie Kelly, a teenage female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. And after facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive. Actor Peter Weller (RoboCop) does a fine job as the aged Bruce Wayne, lured out of retirement to take on the Mutants, a vicious gang of criminals waging a terror campaign in Gotham City. Their brutal methods inspire the Batman to take an equally hard-nosed approach to crime fighting, which draws criticism from the powers that be and praise from the general public, especially 13-year-old Carrie Kelly (Ariel Winter of Modern Family), who becomes the new Robin. Director Jay Oliva and writer Bob Goodman ably condense the first two issues of the Dark Knight story arc into a 76-minute feature that preserves much of Miller's tone; the cast also provides the proper degree of vocal grit, with standout turns from Michael McKean, Gary Anthony Williams, and Michael Emerson in a brief but memorable bit as one of Batman's longest-running foes. Extras are limited to a preview of the second installment of The Dark Knight Returns, which when combined with the quality of the first part, should bring viewers back for the final go-round. ",

Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen), has returned to China after fighting alongside the Allied forces in Europe, bringing some dark secrets from his past along with him.

But at night, he takes to the street as a masked warrior, determined to subvert the Japanese invasion while becoming entangled with the sultry Kiki (Shu Qi), who has a dangerous secret of her own. When his past catches up to him, Zhen is faced with near impossible odds- but his skills are formidable, and he's up to the challenge.\r\nCombining the best of today's martial arts and superhero action with the classic spy thrillers of the past (and a healthy dose of film noir on top), LEGEND OF THE FIST is the rare action film that truly gives the audience something they've never seen before.",

      "ProductDescription": "DC Universe's original animated movie takes on one of the most acclaimed texts among Batman fans: Frank Miller's Year One, which retold the Dark Knight's origins as a crime fighter from a decidedly hard-boiled point of view. The feature follows Miller's story arc faithfully, with young Bruce Wayne (voiced by Benjamin McKenzie of Southland) arriving in a vice-ridden Gotham with a decade's worth of martial arts training and a head full of vengeance over his parents' murder. At the same time, new police transfer Jim Gordon (Bryan Cranston, Breaking Bad) settles into his job, where he discovers that the police are often worse than the criminals. What follows is an inversion of the traditional superhero story, with both men, ostensibly on the side of law and order, taking the business of saving Gotham into their own hands, with Gordon untangling the web of corruption around the city while Wayne, as Batman, adopts a more hands-on (read: violent pummeling) approach. The feature, codirected by Lauren Montgomery and Sam Liu (who previously shared helming duties on Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths), captures the visceral grit of Miller's take, but not the depth of character and story, which made the source material so rich. Exposition is delivered through cumbersome voice-over, while the plentiful action threatens to overwhelm the scant characterizations afforded by Tab Murphy's script. Casting is another mixed bag, with Cranston delivering Gordon's frustration and fury with skill, but McKenzie and Katee Sackhoff (as Sarah Essen, Gordon's lover and future wife) not quite striking the same balance. Striking the right combination of Miller's literary leanings in the original text with the visual elements required to keep an animated feature interesting is a formidable challenge, and one that the makers of Batman: Year One got only partially right. When Gotham City is in desperate need of heroes, two men take a stand for justiceâ¦but on opposite sides. Bruce Wayne returns home after years abroad to become a crimefighter, just as honest cop Lt. James Gordon moves to Gotham and finds corruption at every level. When Bruce becomes the masked vigilante Batman, the city explodes as his new nemesis Catwoman, the mob and Gordon all close in! Donât miss this thrilling DC Universe Animated Original Movie based on the groundbreaking story by Frank Miller and featuring Bryan Cranston, Ben McKenzie, Katee Sackhoff, Eliza Dushku, Alex Rocco and Jon Polito in its stellar voice cast. Experience a bold and dynamic vision of the Dark Knightâs first year in action and the start of his enduring friendship with Jim Gordon. ",

Sherlock Holmes has always been the smartest man in the room... until now. There is a new criminal mastermind at large - Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) - and not only is he Holmes' intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may give him an advantage over the renowned detective. Around the globe, headlines break the news: a scandal takes down an Indian cotton tycoon; a Chinese opium trader dies of an apparent overdose; bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna; the death of an American steel magnate... No one sees the connective thread between these seemingly random events - no one, that is, except the great Sherlock Holmes, who has discerned a deliberate web of death and destruction. At its center sits a singularly sinister spider: Moriarty. Holmes' investigation into Moriarty's plot becomes more dangerous as it leads him and Watson out of London to France, Germany and finally Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead, and moving perilously close to completing his ominous plan. If he succeeds, it will not only bring him immense wealth and power but alter the course of history. ",
