      Ratings used within our system are oftentimes provided by the manufacturer of the product. 
      Because of the differences in ratings used by these companies, we have combined their systems, 
      with the descriptions of the ratings listed above. Animegination does not set ratings 
      (except for its own products) and is not responsible for errors, omissions, 
      or inaccurate ratings. These ratings are guidelines only, and are subject to change. 
      Should you find that the ratings listed here are not accurate, or would like to suggest 
      a rating for titles which do not have one at present, please contact us at
